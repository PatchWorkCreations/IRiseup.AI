By lowering your taxable income, deductions reduce the amount of tax you owe indirectly, based on your tax bracket. Examples include student loan interest, mortgage interest, and charitable contributions.&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Tax Credits: Directly reduce the amount of taxes you owe.

The amount varies depending on filing status (e.g., Single, Married Filing Jointly, Head of Household).&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Itemized Deductions: Instead of taking the standard deduction, taxpayers may choose to itemize deductions, which allows them to claim specific expenses like medical costs, mortgage interest, and state/local taxes.

Taxes can significantly reduce the value of an estate if not planned for properly, and understanding how estate and inheritance taxes work is crucial for minimizing tax liability. In this lesson, we will explore key components of estate planning, including estate taxes, inheritance taxes, and strategies for reducing the tax burden on your heirs.&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;header&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Key Points:&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;header&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;What Is Estate Tax?&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Estate tax is a tax levied on the total value of a deceased person\u2019s estate before the assets are distributed to heirs. The tax is applied at the federal level in some countries, and certain states may also impose their own estate taxes.&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In the U.S., the federal estate tax only applies to estates with a value above a certain threshold, known as the estate tax exemption. As of 2024, this threshold is $12.92 million per individual, meaning most estates will not be subject to the federal estate tax.&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The estate tax rate can range from 18% to 40%, depending on the size of the estate.&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;header&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;What Is Inheritance Tax?&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Inheritance tax is different from estate tax because it is levied on the recipients of an inheritance rather than on the estate itself. This tax is imposed by a few states in the U.S., and the rate depends on the relationship between the decedent and the beneficiary (closer relatives often face lower tax rates).&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Not all beneficiaries are subject to inheritance tax. For example, surviving spouses and sometimes children are often exempt in states that impose this tax.&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;header&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Key Components of Estate Planning:&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Wills and Trusts: A will outlines how your assets will be distributed upon your death, while trusts can help manage and distribute assets during your lifetime and after. Trusts can also help reduce estate taxes and avoid probate.&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Gifting Strategy: The IRS allows individuals to make annual gifts up to a certain amount ($17,000 per recipient in 2024) without incurring gift tax. Gifting during your lifetime can reduce the size of your taxable estate.&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Life Insurance: Life insurance proceeds are generally not subject to income tax, but they can be included in your taxable estate if you own the policy. Transferring ownership of the policy to a trust or another individual can prevent it from being included in your estate.&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;header&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Trusts and Tax Efficiency:&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Revocable Trusts: These trusts can be changed or revoked during the grantor&#x27;s lifetime and are useful for managing assets. However, they do not provide tax benefits since the assets are still considered part of the taxable estate.&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Irrevocable Trusts: These trusts cannot be altered once established, and assets placed in an irrevocable trust are generally removed from the taxable estate. This can be a powerful tool for reducing estate taxes.&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Charitable Trusts: Charitable giving can also reduce estate taxes. Assets placed in a charitable trust are excluded from the estate, and beneficiaries can receive tax deductions for charitable contributions.&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;header&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Portability of Estate Tax Exemption:&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;In the U.S., a surviving spouse can take advantage of the portability of the estate tax exemption. If the first spouse to die does not use up their entire estate tax exemption, the surviving spouse can \&quot;inherit\&quot; the unused portion, effectively doubling the exemption to nearly $25.84 million for a married couple (as of 2024).&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;header&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax (GSTT):&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;The generation-skipping transfer tax applies to transfers of wealth to individuals more than one generation below the donor (e.g., grandchildren).
