JavaScript can detect these events and execute code in response..&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;\u2022   The most common event is the click event. You can use JavaScript to perform an action when a button is clicked:.&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;&lt;button onclick=\&quot;alert(&#x27;Button clicked!&#x27;)\&quot;&gt;Click Me&lt;/button&gt;.&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;2.\tDOM Manipulation:.&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;\u2022   The DOM (Document Object Model) is the structure of your HTML page, which JavaScript can interact with to change elements dynamically..&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;\u2022   Use JavaScript to select and manipulate HTML elements:.&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;document.getElementById(\&quot;demo\&quot;).innerHTML = \&quot;Text has changed!\&quot;;.&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;\u2022   In this example, JavaScript changes the text of an HTML element with the ID demo..&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;3.\tForm Validation:.&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;\u2022   JavaScript is commonly used to validate forms before they are submitted to the server. For example, you can check whether required fields are filled in or whether the email entered is valid:.&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;function validateForm() {.&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;var x = document.forms[\&quot;myForm\&quot;][\&quot;fname\&quot;].value;.&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;if (x == \&quot;\&quot;) {.&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;alert(\&quot;Name must be filled out\&quot;);.&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;return false;.&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;}.&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;}.&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;4.\tChanging CSS with JavaScript:.&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;\u2022   JavaScript can change the styles of HTML elements dynamically, allowing you to create interactive effects like changing colors or hiding/showing elements:.&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;document.getElementById(\&quot;myElement\&quot;).style.color = \&quot;blue\&quot;;.&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;5.\tResponding to User Input:.&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;\u2022   Use JavaScript to respond to user input in real time. For example, display a message when a user types into a form field or updates a page dynamically based on the user\u2019s interaction..&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Pro Tip: JavaScript and the DOM go hand-in-hand. Practice using JavaScript to manipulate the DOM by changing content, attributes, or styles based on user actions..&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Engagement:.&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;Add an interactive feature to your web page, such as a button that changes text or color when clicked.

Examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite..&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;\u2022   Relational databases use SQL (Structured Query Language) to manage and query the data..&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;\u2022   Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL): These databases store data in formats like documents or key-value pairs, and they\u2019re more flexible than relational databases. Examples include MongoDB and Cassandra..&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;\u2022   NoSQL databases are useful for handling large volumes of unstructured data, such as social media posts or user-generated content..&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;3.\tBasic Database Operations:.&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;\u2022   CRUD Operations: These are the four basic operations for interacting with databases:.&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;\u2022   Create: Add new data (e.g., adding a new user)..&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;\u2022   Read: Retrieve existing data (e.g., fetching a list of products)..&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;\u2022   Update: Modify existing data (e.g., changing a user\u2019s password)..&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;\u2022   Delete: Remove data (e.g., deleting a user account)..&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;4.\tConnecting a Database to Your Web Application:.&quot;}, {&quot;type&quot;: &quot;paragraph&quot;, &quot;content&quot;: &quot;\u2022   To use a database in a web application, you\u2019ll need to connect it to your backend code.
