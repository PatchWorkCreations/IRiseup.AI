        <h1>Subscription Terms</h1>
        <p>Please read these Subscription Terms thoroughly and carefully. The purpose of these Subscription Terms is to establish the terms and conditions under which you obtain access to our AI-powered learning materials and other services. Should you have any questions, don’t hesitate to contact us through the <a href="#">Support Center</a>.</p>

        <p>These Subscription Terms are incorporated by reference into the Terms and Conditions of iRiseUp.AI (“iRiseUp.AI“, or “we“), and form part of the agreement between you, as a user of the website <a href="https://www.iriseup.ai">www.iriseup.ai</a> (“Website”) or the iRiseUp.AI app available at the App Store (“App”), and iRiseUp.AI.</p>

        <h2>Trial</h2>
        <p>We may offer a paid trial subscription for services provided through the Website and/or the App. Unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the end of the trial, you will be automatically charged the price indicated on the payment screen for the chosen subscription period, and the trial will convert into a subscription.</p>

        <h2>Subscription</h2>
        <p>The subscription renews automatically at the end of each period (monthly, quarterly, or as otherwise selected by you at the time of purchase) until you cancel.</p>

        <h2>Payment Method</h2>
        <p>Payment will be charged to the payment method you provided at the time of purchase upon confirmation of purchase. You authorize us to store your payment data as necessary to provide our services and to automatically charge the applicable fees to the payment method you submit.</p>

        <h2>Cancellation</h2>
        <p>Canceling your trial or subscription means that the automatic renewal will be disabled, but you will still have access to all your subscription features for the remaining time of the then-current period. Please note that deleting the app does not cancel your subscription.</p>
        <p>If you purchased a subscription or enabled a trial on the App Store: You can cancel a trial or a subscription anytime by turning off auto-renewal through your Apple ID account settings. To avoid being charged, cancel the subscription in your Apple ID account settings at least 24 hours before the end of the free trial or current subscription period. Managing your subscription is solely your responsibility. For more details, refer to Apple’s support page.</p>
        <p>If you purchased a subscription or enabled a trial on our website: You can cancel a trial or subscription by clicking the “Unsubscribe” button in your account before the end of the trial or current subscription, or by contacting our support through the <a href="#">Support Center</a>.</p>

        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws, we may change subscription fees at any time. We will give you reasonable notice of any such pricing changes by posting the new prices on the App and/or by sending you an email notification, or another prominent method. If you do not wish to pay the new fees, you can cancel the applicable subscription before the change takes effect.</p>

        <h2>Refunds</h2>
        <p>These refund rights and conditions apply in addition to any refund rights available to you under applicable laws. If you are uncertain whether you are eligible for a refund, please contact our support team at the email address below, and we will work together to find the best solution.</p>
        <p>If you purchased a subscription or enabled a trial on the App Store: If you are eligible for a refund under Apple’s refund policy, please request it directly from Apple, as they manage all refunds. Follow the instructions on Apple’s support page to request a refund from the App Store.</p>
        <p>If you purchased a subscription or enabled a trial on our website: If you made a purchase directly on our website and the money-back option (“Money-back guarantee”) was presented to you during checkout, you are eligible for a voluntary refund provided that you contact us within 30 days of your initial purchase and before the end of your first subscription period, and the following conditions are met:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You have followed the learning curriculum for at least 21 consecutive days within the first 30 days after purchase, and</li>
            <li>You provide reasons and evidence for the refund other than personal or financial ones (e.g., the content was defective or completely inaccurate).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you contact us through the <a href="#">Support Center</a>, we will review your application and notify you by email whether your application is approved.</p>

        <h3>Important Statement</h3>
        <p>Please note that only fulfillment of all the above requirements allows you to receive a complete voluntary refund under the Money-back guarantee. The Money-back guarantee does not apply to the following cases:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal reasons (e.g., you don’t like the product, it did not meet your expectations, etc.).</li>
            <li>Financial reasons (e.g., you did not expect to be charged, did not realize the trial would convert into a subscription, were unaware the subscription would automatically renew, or that the services are paid, etc.).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please note that you may still cancel your subscription without a voluntary refund by contacting us through the <a href="#">Support Center</a>.</p>

        <h3>Note for EU Residents</h3>
        <p>If you are an EU resident, you have the right to withdraw from the agreement for the purchase of digital content without charge and without giving any reason within fourteen (14) days from the date of such agreement.
