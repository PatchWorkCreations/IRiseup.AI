Consequently, we, in particular, better understand in what of our features and content you see the most value and are able to focus on them to enhance your experience and increase the quality of our products.</p>

        <p>We collect data you give us voluntarily (for example, when you enter your gender, financial status, or email). We also collect data automatically (for example, your IP address) and use third-party service providers for such collection.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data you give us:</strong> You provide us with information about yourself when you register for and/or use the Service. For example: age, gender, data on financial status (including your questions regarding financial mindset), email address.</li>
            <li><strong>Data we collect automatically:</strong></li>
            <li>2.1. <strong>Data about how you found us:</strong> We collect data about your referring URL (that is, the place on the Web where you were when you tapped on our ad).</li>
            <li>2.2. <strong>Device and Location data:</strong> We collect data from your device. Examples of such data include: language settings, IP address, time zone, type and model of a device, device settings, operating system and its version.</li>
            <li>2.3. <strong>Usage data:</strong> We record how you interact with our Service. For example, we log your taps/clicks on certain areas of the interface, the features, and content you interact with, how often you use the Service, how long you are in the Service, and your subscription orders. We also record the ads in our Website with which you interact (and the Internet links to which those ads lead).</li>
            <li>2.4. <strong>Transaction data:</strong> When you make payments through the Service, you need to provide financial account data, such as your credit card number, to our third-party service providers. We do not collect or store full credit card number data, though we may receive credit card-related data, data about the transaction, including the date, time, and amount of the transaction, and the type of payment method used.</li>
            <li>2.5. <strong>Cookies:</strong> A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping purposes. Cookies can be either session cookies or persistent cookies. A session cookie expires when you close your browser and is used to make it easier for you to navigate our Service. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. We also use tracking pixels that set cookies to assist with delivering online advertising.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="purposes">3. For what purposes we process your personal data</h2>
        <p>We process your personal data for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>To provide our Service:</strong> This includes enabling you to use the Service in a seamless manner and preventing or addressing Service errors or technical issues. To host personal data and enable our Website to operate and be distributed, we use Amazon Web Services, which are hosting and backend services provided by Amazon.</li>
            <li><strong>To manage your account and provide you with customer support:</strong> We process your personal data to respond to your requests for technical support, service information, or any other communication you initiate. This includes accessing your account to address technical support requests. For this purpose, we may send you, for example, notifications or emails about the performance of our Service, security, payment transactions, notices regarding our Terms and Conditions, or this Privacy Policy.</li>
            <li><strong>To communicate with you regarding your use of our Service:</strong> We communicate with you, for example, by email. These may include information about the Service, some critical changes, or special offers. To opt-out of receiving emails, you should click the unsubscribe link in the footer of our email. The services that we use for these purposes may collect data concerning the date and time when the message was viewed by our users, as well as when they interacted with it, such as by clicking on links included in the message. FreshDesk provides us with message and customer service tools, which enable us to communicate with you within the Service. When you chat with us via in-Service chat, some of your information is automatically transferred to FreshDesk. The transfer is required to enable us to identify (if you shared any name-related data with us) and to communicate with you in the in-Service chat. Thus, FreshDesk uses this data to provide and fulfill its services (as set forth in their terms of service).</li>
            <li><strong>To research and analyze your use of the Service:</strong> This helps us to better understand our business, analyze our operations, maintain, improve, innovate, plan, design, and develop the Service and our new products. We also use such data for statistical analysis purposes, to test and improve our offers. This enables us to better understand what features and learning plans of the Services our users like more, and what categories of users use our Services. As a consequence, we often decide how to improve the Service based on the results obtained from this processing. For example, if we discover that users more often engage in specific topics about investments, we may develop and introduce extra chapters into this category.</li>
            <li><strong>To analyze how visitors use our Service and to measure the effectiveness of some ads:</strong> We use Google Analytics, a web analysis program of Google, to provide us with analytics. Google Analytics places cookies on your device. On Google Analytics we get, in particular, aggregated information on the data you enter on our Service and users’ interactions within the Service. Google allows you to influence the collection and processing of information generated by Google, in particular, by installing a browser plug-in, available <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout">here</a>. We also use Amplitude, which is an analytics service provided by Amplitude Inc. We use this tool to understand how customers use our Service. Amplitude collects various technical information, in particular, time zone, type of device (phone or tablet), and unique identifiers. Amplitude also allows us to track various interactions that occur on the Website. As a result, Amplitude helps us to decide what features should we focus on. Amplitude is EU-US Privacy Shield certified. Amplitude provides more information on how they process data in its Privacy Policy.</li>
            <li><strong>To send you marketing communications:</strong> We process your personal data for our marketing campaigns. We may add your email address to our marketing list, provided we receive consent or otherwise establish a legal basis for sending you marketing communications. As a result, you will receive information about our products, such as special offers. If you do not want to receive marketing emails from us, you can unsubscribe by following the instructions in the footer of the marketing emails. To communicate with you we use ActiveCampaign, which is a message sending service. We integrate Amplitude to create analytics-based audiences and track opening and conversion events.</li>
            <li><strong>To personalize our ads:</strong> We and our partners, including Facebook and Google, use your personal data to tailor ads and possibly even show them to you at the relevant time. We value your right to influence the ads that you see, thus we are letting you know what service providers we use for this purpose and how some of them allow you to control your ad preferences.</li>
        </ul>
